# Word-Guess-Game

# Description
Hangman game with an US presidents theme

# Directions
When the game is loaded, a set of blanks will be displayed to show the number of letters in the word.
Each word is an US President. The player guesses if a letter is in the name by pressing a letter key.  If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the appropriate blank. If the letter is not in the word, the number of guesses will decrease and the guessed letter will show up at the bottom of the screen.

The player has 9 guesses to figure out the president.  If they guess correctly before they run out of guesses, the win count will increase by 1.  If they run out of guesses, an alert will popup and a new round begins.  

# Purpose
This game was my first attempt to use JavaScript to make a dynamic website.  The HTML format was created with a Bootstrap template and style was added using a CSS file.  All variables and functions were coded in JavaScript.
